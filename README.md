# Austy Labs

Welcome to the official sandbox and dev lab for live show automation, production tooling, and broadcast operations built by Austin Champion (aka AustyChamp) — Lead Show Producer at HyperX Arena Las Vegas.

This repo houses tools, scripts, and documentation for automating and optimizing arena-level productions using a real-world stack that includes:

- Ross Acuity switcher
- Ross XPression graphics engine
- Tessera panel control
- mc360 audio board
- Dante video/audio routing
- OBS & Discord REMI workflows

## What I'm Building

Tools to accelerate show execution, reduce repetitive tasks, and keep large-scale productions clean and efficient. Current areas of focus:

- OBS scene switchers and Discord-triggered routing
- Show-start bots for Discord / Twitch alerting
- Run-of-show (ROS) auto-parsing and prep
- XPression + Tessera template versioning
- Dante route templates and signal chain documentation

## Philosophy

> "If I have to do it more than twice, I’ll automate it."  
Austy Labs is here to bridge the creative, technical, and operational layers of a modern broadcast—from live game capture to in-arena screen control to stream overlays and social triggers.
